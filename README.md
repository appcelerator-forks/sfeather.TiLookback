# TiLookback
## Description

The TiLookback module wraps the Lookback iOS SDK for use in Titanium Mobile Applications

##### iOS Lookback SDK
version 0.6 HD
This module should only be used in adHoc or development projects.  If you wish to use it in App Store projects, replace the Loopback.framework in this repo with the 'safe' version available from Loopback.io

##### ToDo

* add enteredView()
* add exitedView()
* add LookbackSettingsViewController

##### Notes

You will need to modify the module.xconfig to point to the location of the Lookback.framework on your local system.
